# The number 89 in the decimal number system (base 10) is written as 89.
# The decimal system is the standard numerical system used in everyday life and consists of digits from 0 to 9.
# Each digit in a number has a place value, which is a power of 10.
# For 89:
# The "8" is in the tens place, so its value is 8×10=80.
# The "9" is in the ones place, so its value is  9×1=9.
# Thus, # 89=80+9.
